          <h1>Meeting Transcripts</h1>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">Meeting Held: April 3, 2020</p>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">Presenter(s): Blackie Naylor</p>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">[Blackie speaks in cat voice] Thank you all for joining me online today. My name is Blackie, I am a sixteen year old long-haired domestic cat, or feline, as some call us. It is my pleasure to explain the benefits of owning us, and hopefully after this presentation, you make the right choice to bring a cat home. Many folks have yet to experience the traits and skills inherent to us cats. Do not focus on our cuteness or size, because it is scientifically proven cats are descendants of lions. We have lots of skills and abilities and want to share them with you. You too, can own a wild hunter.</p>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">[Clears throat] Now, without further adieu, please allow me to present a visual diagram of each skill in relation to our total skill makeup.</p>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">[Multiple hands raised] Yes, I can take one question now, but please hold others until the end. It is my pleasure to answer all questions at that time.</p>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">[Katie Johnson, VP of Marketing, Pet Owners, Inc.] Um, yes, Mr. Blackie, why are some skill areas so low?</p>
          <p class="transcripts-modal-p">[Blackie speaks] Excellent question. In fact, that was the perfect segway, Mrs. Johnson. Thank you for that. Please, allow me to clarify, the percentage of each skill is not based on 100%. Instead, it is a portion of our total skill makeup. We have stronger skills in some areas, although they are all strong. For example, Can Clean Myself is given 6%; however, we clean ourselves all-the-time. Notice we have 60% in the Being Cute category. All this means is the benefit brought to your lives by our cuteness is undeniable, unquantifiable, and honestly, in our opinion, reason enough to stop listening right now and buy one of us. Now, everyone please follow me to Petco.</p>
